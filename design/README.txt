To compile and run:

You need a fresh copy of os161, as described in the PA0 handout. If you do not have this, follow the instructions in '2. Getting Started' in said handout. However, instead of following 2.3.2 to get the source code, extract the compressed src in this submission to a directory called ~/os161/src (there should not be a nested src within src). navigate to ~/os161/src/kern/compile/DUMBVM. Continue to follow the steps in the aforementioned handout to build os161.

In order to run, navigate to ~/os161/root. Be sure you have copied a sample configuration file to the root directory. It may be wise to increase the memory in conf.sys161 if you plan on running tests. Run the kernel using 'sys161 kernel' or 'sys161 -w kernel'.
